Did a significant upgrade of the labeling and port placement code

Added `parameters` - ports that appear on the top of the node with vertical type

Added `constants` - nodes that are drawn slightly differently.  Used to connect to parameters.

Added `edge labels` - an extra parameter on the compact edge spec to add a label

Fixed the width and height calculations for nodes.  Everything is much smaller now.

Made the text width function more accurate meaning better feature sizes, better text placement
